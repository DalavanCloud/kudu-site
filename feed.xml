These features are designed to make Kudu easier to scale for certain workloads,
like time series. This post will introduce these features, and discuss how to use
them to effectively design tables for scalability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Kudu’s initial release, tables have had the constraint that once created,
the set of partitions is static. This forces users to plan ahead and create
enough partitions for the expected size of the table, because once the table is
created no further partitions can be added. When using hash partitioning,
creating more partitions is as straightforward as specifying more buckets. For
range partitioning, however, knowing where to put the extra partitions ahead of
time can be difficult or impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common solution to this problem in other distributed databases is to allow
range partitions to split into smaller child range partitions. Unfortunately,
range splitting typically has a large performance impact on running tables,
since child partitions need to eventually be recompacted and rebalanced to a
remote server. Range splitting is particularly thorny with Kudu, because rows
are stored in tablets in primary key sorted order, which does not necessarily
match the range partitioning order. If the range partition key is different than
the primary key, then splitting requires inspecting and shuffling each
individual row, instead of splitting the tablet in half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-and-dropping-range-partitions&quot;&gt;Adding and Dropping Range Partitions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to range partition splitting, Kudu now allows range partitions
to be added and dropped on the fly, without locking the table or otherwise
affecting concurrent operations on other partitions. This solution is not
strictly as powerful as full range partition splitting, but it strikes a good
balance between flexibility, performance, and operational overhead.
Additionally, this feature does not preclude range splitting in the future if
there is a push to implement it. To support adding and dropping range
partitions, Kudu had to remove an even more fundamental restriction when using
range partitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, range partitions could only be created by specifying split points.
Split points divide an implicit partition covering the entire range into
contiguous and disjoint partitions. When using split points, the first and last
partitions are always unbounded below and above, respectively. A consequence of
the final partition being unbounded is that datasets which are range-partitioned
on a column that increases in value over time will eventually have far more rows
in the last partition than in any other. Unbalanced partitions are commonly
referred to as hotspots, and until Kudu 0.10 they have been difficult to avoid
when storing time series data in Kudu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2016-08-23-new-range-partitioning-features/range-partitioning-on-time.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure above shows the tablets created by two different attempts to
partition a table by range on a timestamp column. The first, above in blue, uses
split points. The second, below in green, uses bounded range partitions
specified during table creation. With bounded range partitions, there is no
longer a guarantee that every possible row has a corresponding range partition.
As a result, Kudu will now reject writes which fall in a ‘non-covered’ range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that tables are no longer required to have range partitions covering all
possible rows, Kudu can support adding range partitions to cover the otherwise
unoccupied space. Dropping a range partition will result in unoccupied space
where the range partition was previously. In the example above, we may want to
add a range partition covering 2017 at the end of the year, so that we can
continue collecting data in the future. By lazily adding range partitions we
avoid hotspotting, avoid the need to specify range partitions up front for time
periods far in the future, and avoid the downsides of splitting. Additionally,
historical data which is no longer useful can be efficiently deleted by dropping
the entire range partition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-hash-partitioning&quot;&gt;What About Hash Partitioning?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Kudu’s hash partitioning feature originally shipped in version 0.6, it has
been possible to create tables which combine hash partitioning with range
partitioning. The new range partitioning features continue to work seamlessly
when combined with hash partitioning. Just as before, the number of tablets
which comprise a table will be the product of the number of range partitions and
the number of hash partition buckets. Adding or dropping a range partition will
result in the creation or deletion of one tablet per hash bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2016-08-23-new-range-partitioning-features/range-and-hash-partitioning.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diagram above shows a time series table range-partitioned on the timestamp
and hash-partitioned with two buckets. The hash partitioning could be on the
timestamp column, or it could be on any other column or columns in the primary
key. In this example only two years of historical data is needed, so at the end
of 2016 a new range partition is added for 2017 and the historical 2014 range
partition is dropped. This causes two new tablets to be created for 2017, and
the two existing tablets for 2014 to be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning with the Kudu 0.10 release, users can add and drop range partitions
through the Java and C++ client APIs. Range partitions on existing tables can be
dropped and replacements added, but it requires the servers and all clients to
be updated to 0.10.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dan Burkert</name></author><summary>Kudu 0.10 is shipping with a few important new features for range partitioning.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users may now manually manage the partitioning of a range-partitioned table
by adding or dropping range partitions after a table has been created. This
can be particularly helpful for time-series workloads. Dan Burkert posted
an &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/23/new-range-partitioning-features.html&quot;&gt;in-depth blog&lt;/a&gt; today
detailing the new feature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-master (HA) Kudu clusters are now significantly more stable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Administrators may now reserve a certain amount of disk space on each of its
configured data directories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kudu’s integration with Spark has been substantially improved and is much
more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Berkeley spent some time working on the Spark integration this week
to add support for UPSERT as well as other operations.
Dan Burkert pitched in a bit with some &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-kudu-dev/201608.mbox/%3CCALo2W-XBoSz9cbhXi81ipubrAYgqyDiEeHz-ys8sPAshfcik6w%40mail.gmail.com%3E&quot;&gt;suggestions&lt;/a&gt;
which were then integrated in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3871/&quot;&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;
provided by Will.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After some reviews by Dan, Chris George, and Ram Mettu, the patch was committed
in time for the upcoming 0.10.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dan Burkert also completed work for the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3854/&quot;&gt;manual partitioning APIs&lt;/a&gt;
in the Java client. After finishing up the basic implementation, Dan also made some
cleanups to the related APIs in both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3958/&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3882/&quot;&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt; clients.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dan and Misty Stanley-Jones also collaborated to finish the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3796/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;
for this new feature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adar Dembo worked on some tooling to allow users to migrate their Kudu clusters
from a single-master configuration to a multi-master one. Along the way, he
started building some common infrastructure for command-line tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Since Kudu’s initial release, it has included separate binaries for different
administrative or operational tools (e.g. &lt;code&gt;kudu-ts-cli&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;kudu-ksck&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;kudu-fs_dump&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;log-dump&lt;/code&gt;, etc). Despite having similar usage, these tools don’t share much code,
and the separate statically linked binaries make the Kudu packages take more disk
space than strictly necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Adar’s work has introduced a new top-level &lt;code&gt;kudu&lt;/code&gt; binary which exposes a set of subcommands,
much like the &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; binaries with which readers may be familiar.
For example, a new tool he has built for dumping peer identifiers from a tablet’s
consensus metadata is triggered using &lt;code&gt;kudu tablet cmeta print_replica_uuids&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This new tool will be available in the upcoming 0.10.0 release; however, migration
of the existing tools to the new infrastructure has not yet been completed. We
expect that by Kudu 1.0, the old tools will be removed in favor of more subcommands
of the &lt;code&gt;kudu&lt;/code&gt; tool.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Todd Lipcon picked up the work started by David Alves in July to provide
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/2642/&quot;&gt;“exactly-once” semantics&lt;/a&gt; for write operations.
Todd carried the patch series through review and also completed integration of the
feature into the Kudu server processes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After testing the feature for several days on a large cluster under load,
the team decided to enable this new feature by default in Kudu 0.10.0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mike Percy resumed working on garbage collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/2853/&quot;&gt;past versions of
updated and deleted rows&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3076/&quot;&gt;main
patch for the feature&lt;/a&gt; went through
several rounds of review and testing, but unfortunately missed the cut-off
for 0.10.0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alexey Serbin’s work to add doxygen-based documentation for the C++ Client API
was &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3840/&quot;&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; this week. These
docs will be published as part of the 0.10.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alexey also continued work on implementing the &lt;code&gt;AUTO_FLUSH_BACKGROUND&lt;/code&gt; write
mode for the C++ client. This feature makes it easier to implement high-throughput
ingest using the C++ API by automatically handling the batching and flushing of writes
based on a configurable buffer size.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Alexey’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3952/&quot;&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; has received several
rounds of review and looks likely to be committed soon. Detailed performance testing
will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Ram Mettu for committing his first patch to Kudu this week!
Ram fixed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1522&quot;&gt;bug in handling Alter Table with TIMESTAMP columns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a couple months of work, Dan Burkert finished
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3648/&quot;&gt;adding add/remove range partition support&lt;/a&gt;
in the C++ client and in the master.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dan also posted a patch for review which &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3854/&quot;&gt;adds support for this
feature&lt;/a&gt; to the Java client. Dan is
expecting that this will be finished in time for the upcoming Kudu 0.10.0
release.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Misty Stanley-Jones started working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3796/&quot;&gt;documentation for this
feature&lt;/a&gt;. Readers of this
blog are encouraged to check out the docs and provide feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adar Dembo also completed fixing most of the issues related to high availability
using multiple Kudu master processes. The upcoming Kudu 0.10.0 release will support
running multiple masters and transparently handling a transient failure of any
master process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Although multi-master should now be stable, some work remains in this area. Namely,
Adar is working on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3393/&quot;&gt;design for handling permanent failure of a machine hosting
a master&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, the administrator
will need to use some new tools to create a new master replica by copying data from
an existing one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Todd Lipcon started a

on the dev mailing list about renaming the Kudu feature which creates new
replicas of tablets after they become under-replicated.  Since its initial
introduction, this feature was called “remote bootstrap”, but Todd pointed out
that this naming caused some confusion with the other “bootstrap” term used to
describe the process by which a tablet loads itself at startup.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The discussion concluded with an agreement to rename the process to “Tablet Copy”.
Todd provided patches to perform this rename, which were committed at the end of the
week last week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dan Burkert contributed a few patches that repackage the Java client under &lt;code&gt;org.apache.kudu&lt;/code&gt;
in place of &lt;code&gt;org.kududb&lt;/code&gt;. This was done in a &lt;strong&gt;backward-incompatible&lt;/strong&gt; way, meaning that import
statements will have to be modified in existing Java code to compile against a newer Kudu JAR
version (from 0.10.0 onward). This stems from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/kudu-dev/201605.mbox/%3CCAGpTDNcJohQBgjzXafXJQdqmBB4sL495p5V_BJRXk_nAGWbzhA@mail.gmail.com%3E&quot;&gt;a discussion&lt;/a&gt;
initiated in May. It won’t have an impact on C++ or Python users, and it isn’t affecting wire
compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still on the Java-side, J-D Cryans pushed &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3055/&quot;&gt;a patch&lt;/a&gt;
that completely changes how Exceptions are managed. Before this change, users had to introspect
generic Exception objects, making it a guessing game and discouraging good error handling.
Now, the synchronous client’s methods throw &lt;code&gt;KuduException&lt;/code&gt; which packages a &lt;code&gt;Status&lt;/code&gt; object
that can be interrogated. This is very similar to how the C++ API works.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Existing code that uses the new Kudu JAR should still compile since this change replaces generic
&lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; with a more specific &lt;code&gt;KuduException&lt;/code&gt;. Error handling done by string-matching the
exception messages should now use the provided &lt;code&gt;Status&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alexey Serbin’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3619/&quot;&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; that adds Doxygen-based
documentation was pushed and the new API documentation for C++ developers will be available
with the next release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Todd has made many improvements to the &lt;code&gt;ksck&lt;/code&gt; tool over the last week. Building upon Will
Berkeley’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3632/&quot;&gt;WIP patch for KUDU-1516&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ksck&lt;/code&gt; can
now detect more problematic situations like if a tablet doesn’t have a majority of replicas on
live tablet servers, or if those replicas aren’t in a good state.
&lt;code&gt;ksck&lt;/code&gt; is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3705/&quot;&gt;now faster&lt;/a&gt; when run against a large
cluster with a lot of tablets, among other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned last week, Dan has been working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3648/&quot;&gt;adding add/remove range partition support&lt;/a&gt;
in the C++ client and in the master. The patch has been through many rounds of review and
testing and it’s getting close to completion. Meanwhile, J-D started looking at adding support
for this functionality in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3731/&quot;&gt;Java client&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adar Dembo is also hard at work on the master. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3609/&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3610/&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3611/&quot;&gt;patches&lt;/a&gt; to
have the tablet servers heartbeat to all the masters that he published earlier this month is
getting near the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source columnar storage engine enables fast analytics across the Internet of Things, time series, cybersecurity, and other Big Data applications in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forest Hill, MD –25 July 2016–&lt;/strong&gt; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache® Kudu™ has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project’s community and products have been well-governed under the ASF’s meritocratic process and principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Kudu is an Open Source columnar storage engine built for the Apache Hadoop ecosystem designed to enable flexible, high-performance analytic pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Under the Apache Incubator, the Kudu community has grown to more than 45 developers and hundreds of users,” said Todd Lipcon, Vice President of Apache Kudu and Software Engineer at Cloudera. “We are excited to be recognized for our strong Open Source community and are looking forward to our upcoming 1.0 release.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimized for lightning-fast scans, Kudu is particularly well suited to hosting time-series data and various types of operational data. In addition to its impressive scan speed, Kudu supports many operations available in traditional databases, including real-time insert, update, and delete operations. Kudu enables a “bring your own SQL” philosophy, and supports being accessed by multiple different query engines including such other Apache projects as Drill, Spark, and Impala (incubating).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Kudu is in use at diverse companies and organizations across many industries, including retail, online service delivery, risk management, and digital advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Using Apache Kudu alongside interactive SQL tools like Apache Impala (incubating) has allowed us to deploy a next-generation platform for real-time analytics and online reporting,” said Baoqiu Cui, Chief Architect at Xiaomi. “Apache Kudu has been deployed in production at Xiaomi for more than six months and has enabled us to improve key reliability and performance metrics for our customers. We are excited to see Kudu graduate to a top-level project and look forward to continuing to contribute to its success.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are already seeing the many benefits of Apache Kudu. In fact we’re using its combination of fast scans and fast updates for upcoming releases of our risk solutions,” said Cory Isaacson, CTO at Risk Management Solutions, Inc. “Kudu is performing well, and RMS is proud to have contributed to the project’s integration with Apache Spark.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Internet of Things, cybersecurity and other fast data drivers highlight the demands that real-time analytics place on Big Data platforms,” said Arvind Prabhakar, Apache Software Foundation member and CTO of StreamSets. “Apache Kudu fills a key architectural gap by providing an elegant solution spanning both traditional analytics and fast data access. StreamSets provides native support for Apache Kudu to help build real-time ingestion and analytics for our users.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Graduation to a Top-Level Project marks an important milestone in the Apache Kudu community, but we are really just beginning to achieve our vision of a hybrid storage engine for analytics and real-time processing,” added Lipcon. “As our community continues to grow, we welcome feedback, use cases, bug reports, patch submissions, documentation, new integrations, and all other contributions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apache Kudu project welcomes contributions and community participation through mailing lists, a Slack channel, face-to-face MeetUps, and other events. Catch Apache Kudu in action at Strata + Hadoop World, 26-29 September 2016 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability and Oversight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Apache Kudu software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project’s day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Apache Incubator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Apache Incubator is the entry path for projects and codebases wishing to become part of the efforts at The Apache Software Foundation. All code donations from external organizations and existing external projects wishing to join the ASF enter through the Incubator to: 1) ensure all donations are in accordance with the ASF legal standards; and 2) develop new communities that adhere to our guiding principles. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF. For more information, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://incubator.apache.org/&quot;&gt;http://incubator.apache.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees more than 350 leading Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server –the world’s most popular Web server software. Through the ASF’s meritocratic process known as “The Apache Way,” more than 550 individual Members and 5,300 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide: thousands of software solutions are distributed under the Apache License; and the community actively participates in ASF mailing lists, mentoring initiatives, and ApacheCon, the Foundation’s official user conference, trainings, and expo.

This weekly blog post
covers ongoing development and news in the Apache Kudu (incubating) project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;development-discussions-and-code-in-progress&quot;&gt;Development discussions and code in progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dan Burkert has continued making progress on support for non-covering range partitioned
tables. This past week, he posted a code review for
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3648/&quot;&gt;adding and dropping range partitions to the master&lt;/a&gt;
and another for &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3581/&quot;&gt;handling non-covering ranges in the C++ client&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adar Dembo continued working on addressing multi-master issues, as he explained in this
&lt;a href=&quot;http://kudu.apache.org/2016/06/24/multi-master-1-0-0.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. This past week
he worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3550/&quot;&gt;tackling various race conditions&lt;/a&gt;
that were possible when master operations were submitted concurrent with a master leader election.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Adar also posted patches for most of the remaining known server-side issues, including
posting a comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3611/&quot;&gt;stress test&lt;/a&gt; which issues
client DDL operations concurrent with triggering master crashes and associated failovers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As always, Adar’s commit messages are instructive and fun reads for those interested in
following along.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As mentioned last week, David Alves has been making a lot of progress on the implementation
of the replay cache. Many patches landed in master this week, including:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3192/&quot;&gt;RPC system integration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3449/&quot;&gt;Integration with replicated writes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3519/&quot;&gt;Correctness/stress tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Currently, this new feature is disabled by default, as the support for evicting elements
from the cache is not yet complete. This last missing feature is now
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3628/&quot;&gt;up for review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alexey Serbin has been working on adding Doxygen-based documentation for the public
C++ API. This was originally &lt;a href=&quot;https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-kudu-dev/201606.mbox/%3CCANbMB4wtMz=JKwgKMNPvkjWX3t9NxCeGt04NmL=SyESyzUMWJg@mail.gmail.com%3E&quot;&gt;proposed on the mailing list&lt;/a&gt;
 a couple of weeks ago, and last week, Alexey posted the
 &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3619/&quot;&gt;initial draft of the implementation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-news&quot;&gt;Project news&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-kudu-dev/201607.mbox/%3CCAGpTDNesxH43C-Yt5fNwpEpAxfb2P62Xpdi8AqT8jfvjeqnu0w%40mail.gmail.com%3E&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt;
on the dev mailing list about having an intermediate release, called 0.10.0, before 1.0.0,
has wound down. The consensus seems to be that the development team is in favor of this
release. Accordingly, the version number in the master branch has been changed back to
0.10.0-SNAPSHOT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Todd Lipcon &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3517/&quot;&gt;changed the default&lt;/a&gt;
bloom filter false positive (FP) ratio from 1% to 0.01%. The original value
wasn’t scientifically chosen, but testing with billions of rows on a 5
node cluster showed a 2x insert throughput improvement at the cost of
some more disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;J-D Cryans has been fixing some recently introduced bugs in the Java client.
For example, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3541/&quot;&gt;this patch&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3586/&quot;&gt;that one&lt;/a&gt;. Testability is a major
concern right now in the Java client since triggering those issues requires
a lot of time and data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dan Burkert has been making progress on the non-convering range partitioned
tables front. The Java client &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3388/&quot;&gt;now supports&lt;/a&gt;
such tables and Dan is currently implementing new functionality to add and remove
tablets via simple APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Alves is also making a lot of progress on the replay cache, this new component
on the server-side which makes it possible for tablets to identify client write
operations and enable exactly-once semantics. The main patch is up for review
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3449/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adar Dembo is working on addressing multi-master issues, as he explained in this
&lt;a href=&quot;http://kudu.apache.org/2016/06/24/multi-master-1-0-0.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. He just put
up for review patches that enable tablet servers to heartbeat to all masters. Part
one is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3609/&quot;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Misty prepared a document with J-D that contains instructions on how to release a
new Kudu version. It is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3614/&quot;&gt;up for review here&lt;/a&gt;
if you are curious or want to learn more about this process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-news&quot;&gt;Project news&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://s.apache.org/l6Tw&quot;&gt;vote&lt;/a&gt; to graduate Kudu from the ASF’s Incubator passed!
The next step is for the ASF Board to vote on the resolution at their next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-kudu-dev/201607.mbox/%3CCAGpTDNesxH43C-Yt5fNwpEpAxfb2P62Xpdi8AqT8jfvjeqnu0w%40mail.gmail.com%3E&quot;&gt;a discussion&lt;/a&gt;
on the dev mailing list about having an intermediate release, called 0.10.0, before 1.0.0.
The current issue is that the version in the code is current “1.0.0-SNAPSHOT” which doesn’t
leave room for another other release, but the bigger issue is that code is still churning a
lot which doesn’t make for a stable 1.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This weekly blog post
covers ongoing development and news in the Apache Kudu (incubating) project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;development-discussions-and-code-in-progress&quot;&gt;Development discussions and code in progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Todd Lipcon diagnosed and fixed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/3445&quot;&gt;tricky bug&lt;/a&gt;
which could cause Kudu servers to crash under load. It turned out that the bug
was in a synchronization profiling code path related to the tcmalloc allocator.
This allocator is used in release builds, but can’t be used in instrumented builds
such as
&lt;a href=&quot;http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html&quot;&gt;AddressSanitizer&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html&quot;&gt;ThreadSanitizer&lt;/a&gt;. This made it particularly difficult
to catch. The bug fix will be released in the upcoming 0.9.1 release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Todd also finished and committed a fix for &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1469&quot;&gt;KUDU-1469&lt;/a&gt;,
a bug in which Kudu’s implementation of Raft consensus could get “stuck” not making
progress replicating operations for a tablet. See the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3228/7/src/kudu/integration-tests/raft_consensus-itest.cc&quot;&gt;new integration test case&lt;/a&gt;
for more details on this bug.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mike Percy finished implementing and committed a feature which allows
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3135/&quot;&gt;reserving disk space for non-Kudu processes&lt;/a&gt;.
This feature causes Kudu to stop allocating new data blocks on a
disk if it is within a user-specified threshold of being full, preventing
possible crashes and allowing for safer collocation of Kudu with other processes
on a cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Berkeley finished implementing &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1398&quot;&gt;KUDU-1398&lt;/a&gt;,
a new optimization which reduces the amount of disk space used by
indexing structures in Kudu’s internal storage format. This should
improve storage efficiency for workloads with large keys, and can
also improve write performance by increasing the number of index
entries which can fit in a given amount of cache memory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Alves has completed posting a patch series that implements
exactly-once RPC semantics. The design, as mentioned in previous
blog posts, is described in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/2642/&quot;&gt;design document&lt;/a&gt;
and the patches can be found in a 10-patch series starting with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3190/&quot;&gt;gerrit #3190&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dan Burkert is continuing working on adding support for
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/incubator-kudu/blob/master/docs/design-docs/non-covering-range-partitions.md&quot;&gt;tables with range partitions that don’t cover the entire key
space&lt;/a&gt;.
This past week, he focused on adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3388/&quot;&gt;support in the the Java client&lt;/a&gt;
which also necessitated some serious &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3477/&quot;&gt;refactoring&lt;/a&gt;. These patches
are now under review.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Andrew Wong, a new contributor who committed his
first patches this week. Andrew &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3424/&quot;&gt;improved the build docs for OSX&lt;/a&gt;
and also fixed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3486/&quot;&gt;crash if the user forgot to specify the master address
in some command line tools&lt;/a&gt;.
Thanks, Andrew!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-news&quot;&gt;Project news&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Apache Kudu web site has finished migrating to Apache Software Foundation infrastructure.
The site can now be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://kudu.incubator.apache.org/&quot;&gt;kudu.incubator.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;.
Existing links will automatically redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Kudu 0.9.1 release candidate was posted and passed a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-kudu-dev/201606.mbox/%3CCADY20s6%3D%2BnKNgvx%3DG_pKupQGiH%2B9ToS53LqExBwWM6vLp-ns9A%40mail.gmail.com%3E&quot;&gt;release vote&lt;/a&gt;
by the Kudu Podling PMC (PPMC).
The release candidate will now be voted upon by the Apache Incubator PMC. If all goes well, we
can expect a release late this week. The release fixes a few critical bugs discovered in 0.9.0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chris Mattmann, one of Kudu’s mentors from the Apache Incubator,
started a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-kudu-dev/201606.mbox/%3CAD4A858D-403D-4E74-A4F4-DE2F08FB761E%40jpl.nasa.gov%3E&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt;
about the project’s graduation to a top-level project (TLP).
Initial responses seem to be positive, so the next step will
be to work on a draft resolution and various stages of
voting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Adar Dembo published a post detailing his recent work on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://kudu.apache.org/2016/06/24/multi-master-1-0-0.html&quot;&gt;master fault tolerance in Kudu 1.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
